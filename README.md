# Machine learning in finance
In this repository, I have estimated the purchase price of gas for any date in the past and extrapolated it for one year into the future using ARIMA, neural network, and time series modeling. 
Additionally, I have analyzed a loan book to estimate customers' probabilities of default.
I hope you find this repository helpful!
