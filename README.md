# Machine Learning in Finance

Welcome to the Machine Learning in Finance repository!

## Overview
In this repository, I've explored various machine learning techniques applied to finance-related datasets. Specifically, I've focused on estimating the purchase price of gas for any date in the past and extrapolating it for one year into the future. Additionally, I've analyzed a loan book to estimate customers' probabilities of default.

## Project Details
- **Gas Price Estimation:**
  - Utilized ARIMA, neural network, and time series modeling techniques.
  - Developed models to estimate gas purchase prices retrospectively and forecast future prices.
  
- **Loan Book Analysis:**
  - Estimated customers' probabilities of default based on loan book data.
  - Employed machine learning algorithms for risk assessment and predictive modeling.

## Data Source
The datasets used in this project were obtained from the Forage JP Morgan Quantitative Finance Virtual Experience.

## Repository Contents
- **Gas_Price_Estimation/**
  - Contains notebooks and scripts for gas price estimation using ARIMA, neural network, and time series modeling.

- **Loan_Book_Analysis/**
  - Includes notebooks and scripts for analyzing the loan book and estimating default probabilities.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the provided notebooks and scripts to understand the methodologies used and the results obtained. 

## Feedback
I hope you find this repository helpful! If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy learning!
